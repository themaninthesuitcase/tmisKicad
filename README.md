# themaninthesuitcase KiCad Libraries

A collection of kicad symbols and footprints that I have made and collected.

## Footprint 3D models
The footprints expect foot prints to have a variable `{TMIS_3DMODEL_DIR}` to exist. This should point to the root of the library ie `tmisKicad`.

This will need to be made manually Kicad using **Preferences > Configure Paths...**
